            "p2":"Here there's a junior developer waiting for his first opportunity to develop his abilities to the point of being capable of teaching and leading others. Autonomous, proactive, self-taught, with good interpersonal abilities, goal oriented person. Colaborative teammate with lots of experience working with teams and setting goals and plans.",
            "p3":"I'd like to know more!",
            "p4":"I am a young man of 24 years old (my birthday is April 21st) very excited to grow and learn. Since I was a kid I have been interested in technology, I used to be the friend who brought interesting news, telling about something new that was being developed, something that the news didn't cover, like when Google started talking about Google Glass, or when Oculus Rift came out, I was the one who explained what Artificial Intelligence was and showed them a chatbot that is now a classic (CleverBot). Last year, when we had to make a presentation of our 'dissertations', a group of students had money and bought a wireless controller to show the slides. I came up with the idea to use my phone, researched some apps in English and when I found it, I set it up with my netbook and helped all the groups to have the app and program installed so they could show slides with the phone.",
            "p5":"I would love to tell you about myself in an interview, but if you would like to know a little bit now, I graduated at 18 from a technical school as a Chemical Technician, after which I served 2 years as a volunteer missionary.",
            "p6":"When I came back I started to study Systems Engineering and I said 'YES, THIS IS MINE', I aced my programming subjects and soon after the pandemic started, at that time I worked and got married. Nowadays I can't attend the university because my work has schedules that clash with the courses, but I am very self-taught and I enrolled in a state program called 'Argentina Program', in which I was accepted, then I passed the first stage that lasted 4 months. Now I am in the second and last stage, in which in case of passing I would receive the certificate of 'Full-Stack Developer Junior'.",
            "p7":"I'm VERY excited to have my first job in IT! My wife can testify that I am morning, afternoon and night studying and advancing my own projects waiting for the day when I will have my first job opportunity (which I understand, is very different from what I learned at uni, in my courses and by myself)."
